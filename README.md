# Project-A.E.S.
Project A.E.S. (Affective Emotion System), is a chill vibe-scanner that looks at your face and goes, “ok bet, here’s your mood.” It auto-slaps an emotion + persona on screen so JARVIS stops guessing your feelings. You just exist, it does the vibe check. Low effort for you, high effort for the code.
